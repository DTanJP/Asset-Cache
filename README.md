# Asset-Cache
The standalone cache library

Includes 2 different versions of the cache class along with demonstrations of using the cache class

# Standard version
### Only includes loading the cache and it's contents into memory and cannot do anything else. This is the ideal version for game/application development

# Full version
### Includes loading, extracting files, packing, and adding/removing files to the cache. This version is if you want to create your own asset packer tool by yourself from scratch.

Running either demos should show this: (Demo.cache is required to run the demos)
